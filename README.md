In 2022,I sucessfully completed my PhD, titled 'Capturing geomorphic change in high mountain environments using close-range sensing techniques (Swiss Alps)'.
My research focused on studying talus slope, rock wall and rock glacier dynamics in a permafrost environment in the Valais, Swiss Alps, using mainly UAV photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laserscanning. 

Currently, I'm working on an AI-based approach to process large amounts of time-lapse images for geomorphic research and the detection of environmental change in mountain environments.

New to GitHub and coding in general - but keen to learn and explore.
